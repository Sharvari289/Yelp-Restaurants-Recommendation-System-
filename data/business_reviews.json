(This was the former location for Quizno's). \n\nWhen I walked in, a super cute woman was at the counter, and helped me make some suggestions on what to try.\n\nI went with the kofta skewer and chicken platter, which I chose to have with babaganoush, and Mediterranean salad. Added a side of falafel. My dining partner had the kibbie. \n\nCan I just say, my Middle Eastern (this cuisine is Lebanese to be exact) experiences in Charlotte have now reached a fever pitch with Kabob Grill being pretty good...then La Shish Kabob being excellent, and now ZG, my all-time fave in the city.  \n\nThe chicken is so tender, so well seasoned...the kofta isn't dried out like most places and crusty, it's springy and moist.  The kibbie, I'm told is new and improved with more spice and is worth trying if you've never had it before.  Falafel side...two nice pieces, crispy fried, and drizzled with tahini and comes with pickled vegetables. \n\nPlatters come with dessert too, so we had two small baklava-esque pastry...extra crisp and flaky, fresh and sprinkles with pistachios.  The perfect two-bite size to end a meal. \n\nThe atmosphere is not shady like La Shish (of course it's not, it's in a spankin' new looking Ballantyne shopping center) and the inside is immaculate.  The owner was super sweet, seemed like an older man you want to sit down with and learn his life story.  \n\nOverall, it's a great casual eatery (order at the counter, wait for food type of joint) where the prices are pretty good.

We went a couple of weeks ago on a weeknight, and I have to say, I'm impressed.\n\nHaving traveled to Italy and Greece, we are not strangers to Mediterranean food. Still, it was refreshing to have one of the young men in the restaurant meet our eyes as soon as we walked in, and ask if we'd like an explanation of their menu. He took us over to the case and showed us their kabobs, as well as their sides. He explained how we could order the different combinations, and then left us to confer amongst ourselves.\n\nWe each ordered a platter. I ordered the chicken kabobs, my husband ordered the trio of kabobs. We ordered different sides in order to sample them all: hummus for me, babba ghanouj for my husband.\n\nWe sat down to wait at a table, and after a few minutes they brought out our orders. Interestingly, our kabobs came with the wrong sides on the plates, but frankly this wasn't an issue since we were just doing a big old taste test of everything we could get.\n\nAn older gentleman (perhaps the owner?) came by to present me with a garlic aioli sort of dip for the chicken. It was DELICIOUS and so garlicky! We asked for more, and asked what they called it. \"Chicken sauce,\" he said, with a laugh as he gave away the secret recipe of garlic and fresh mayonnaise. I don't care how simple it was, I loved it.\n\nThe food was fresh and delicious. The staff was smiling and friendly. I couldn't ask for more from a restaurant. Well - maybe if it was sit down service with menus, but I won't dock them for that. Zeitouni is what it is - a counter service restaurant. Their food shines beyond \"counter service\" which implies almost a fast food style. Zeitouni is not \"fast food\" in my opinion. It's delicious, flavorful and fresh, designed to be savored. So it's a bit of a disconnect, but I forgive them for that because well, if you taste this food, you'd forgive just about anything else.\n\nMy recommendation for dining at Zeitouni is that you call ahead and order delicious meals to enjoy in your home. If you're looking for a tasty and fresh lunch, or out for a quick dinner, it's an okay place ambiance-wise, in which to enjoy it, but the fast food feel might turn you off for a date night out. \n\nRegardless of how you enjoy their food, it is amazingly delicious food that is meant to be enjoyed. We'll be back again and again, but likely with a carryout bag to savor in our home. Zeitouni's food, and it's staff are elevated far beyond the atmosphere you'll find when you walk in.", "useful": 3, "funny": 0, "cool": 1}, {"review_id": "-06TcXCN793xMBvqZyt-vg", "user_id": "jr212HQAwMOXGYKkZLfQvA", "business_id": "ExtP8z3SVyut_RICc9i_DA", "stars": 4.0, "date": "2012-08-14", "text": "The next stop on my Charlotte tour of Mediterranean food spots is...Zeitouni Grill!\n\nI work at Toringdon. You know, that office/business complex, right off of 485 on the Johnston Road exit, where the Red Robin and Earth Fare are both located? You know, there? Got it? See it? That building directly across the street from Red Robin? That's where I work. See me waving? Hi!\n\nSo my point to Toringdon is this: other than Red Robin (which, frankly, is pretty meh when it comes to burgers, and the atmosphere sucks) or Earth Fare (which, frankly, their take-out/dine-in options leave plenty to be desired, especially from such a place that supposedly prides itself on health food alternatives that cater to the surplus number of crunchy granolas living in exile from Asheville, and the die-hard fitness freaks that show up all sweaty and red-faced and all jacked-up on adrenaline and self-importance after having done some hardcore yoga at the Urban Active across the street...but anyway...), a quick or at least convenient meal that doesn't require you to get in your car and navigate the fustercluck that is Johnston Road during lunch time, AND you're pretty tired of brown bagging it every day, then what the hell are you going to do for lunch, huh?\n\nThankfully, Zeitouni Grill proves a more-than-welcome respite from the ordinary. And Zeitouni Grill does not disappoint.\n\nThe platters are always a good option. Choose from a trio of Shishes (I just made that word up) - Kabob, Tawooq, or Kefta - or the Shwarma (the \"Avengers\" Special! - You know what I'm talking about!), and you get your choice of two sides - hummus or babba ghanouj (neither will disappoint) and either tabbouleh, fatoush, or the Mediterranean salad. Personally, I love their falafel. I haven't had decent falafel since I left NYC, and this is about as close as what I used to sample when I slummed it on Lexington Avenue near Kips Bay. Simple fare, yet colorful and plenty flavorful, just as I would expect from this kind of cuisine.\n\nKeep in mind this place stays busy during weekday lunch hours, so be prepared to wait about 10-15 minutes for your plate. Worth the wait, though.\n\nI'm here about once a week. But this place is so damned good, I might be coming here more than once a week.

The feel is definitely not the standard Pub environment. It has a hipster lounge/cafe/restaurant feel that attracts friendly drinks/dinner dates. \n\nAlas, the selection of games are very few but still not half as bad as waiting for 2hours. In the cold. \n\nThe entrance is main level and has a fireplace and piano to the far right end of the room. This gives a really cozy feel. Perfect for a quiet dinner on a cold evening. The all around wood furniture gives a warmth about the place. You can walk in and sit anywhere you like - which hones in on the casual atmosphere of a bar. While the staff and upstairs bar section brands a trendy spot with the plush couches and balcony setting overlooking the main quiet dining area. They have a wonderful balance of laid back and trendy. It might have something to do with the alluring candles or the super friendly staff.\n\nThe waiter was a lovely chap with a heavy accent. I couldn't make out exactly where he was from but it could've been Finnish. Nevertheless, he was very friendly and accommodated the 3 of us with menus and time to order. \n\nIf this review was solely based on the menu, this place would get a straight 5. We all know too well that awkward moment when you plunge into the world of intimidating new selections at every restaurant, new and old. That moment where the blood rushes to and fro, brain and stomach. Trying to figure out what sounds good, wont dent your wallet and satisfies your papillae.  This place does JUST that. It presents max 6 options in each section. And not overtly complicated or fancy. If you wanted chicken, they have 3 selections that's it. For many that might be a half full type of adventure, but for me, it's efficient and practical. It's the krypton of turning me into a local - even if I reside in Mississauga. Perhaps I'm traditional in that sense but sometimes classics are not to be messed with. Don't come here expecting varieties. It's a bar. It serves Barf-ood options. For once you wont feel the churning. Well done boys. \n\ndrinks: \nFruili - woohoo. Strawberry beer? do you need more incentive to try this? \nFruili\nginger-ale - bottomless refills - cool beans. \n\n\nApp:\nPoutine Sir - ($8.99) This is the standard poutine with the classic fries, cheese and smothered gravy. I cannot believe this place isn't known for the poutine. It is by far the greatest poutine I have had. With each fat french fry and melted cheese chunk dripping with gravy sauce - I mentally made a note to bring my Montreal friends here for dinner. Like mentioned, the french fries are fat and the serving is large so be sure to share. There wasn't as much cheese as I'd hoped but they really know how to spread that gravy bOi! . A delicious app to tease you into mains. \n\nMain:\n\nSteak Sandwich - (13.99) This sandwich came on a francese bun (reminded me of the new square MacDonald's buns- uncomfortably wider than the meat) with a rosemary-radish aioli spread. Toppings included caramelised onions and fried mushrooms.  The steak is just really thin segments of meat that you cannot taste. It might be because of the large ratio of sweet caramelised onions and bread to the meat. The sweet flavour is throughout in this meal. I wasn't a big fan of it. The sides are either fries or salad. Sadly my buddy chose the salad - not knowing, at the time. how amazing the poutine was. You can add cheddar slice for 1.99 - which hardly seems worth it.  The portion is good enough for one. The side salad is not memorable . Not sure if it's not supposed to have dressing. It seemed bland. \n\n\nHells chicken sandwich - ($12.49)  This was the only chicken sandwich on the menu but it's spicy so I opted against it. Mistake!\nThis is a really tasty sandwich if you are in the Sammy mood and prefer a light meal. Even with the bread, it's a deliciously light choice. The chicken is breaded with chilli spices so it's mainly dry. Toppings include tomato,cheddar cheese, onion, lettuce and a light oil-chipotle spread.  You have the option of converting the classic samm-itch religion into a wrap for $0.99. The flavour is well balanced on the bread but I will def try the wrap next time.  My only complaint about this sandwich is that the dry ingredients tend to fall out. I like having all the items of my meal together, so I can relish all the different bits of gusto equally. \n\nChicken Farfalle - ($14.99) This is a plate of bowtie pasta with chicken, fried spinach leaves,grilled and fried red onions and red peppers.The sauce is oil based which makes it extremely greasy. Not in a good way. I could barely taste the herbs because of how lubricated each piece was. The portion is large enough to share but the oil consistency was too much. I really think they should serve a side of bread. Myeh.\ntotal= $85.73\nThe service was friendly&casual.

Had great masu, Hamachi, akami, ika, and (an especially amazing) hotate on our first visit. Everything was of great quality, and large thick pieces with lightly-vinegared perfectly-formed rice. \nTORO TAKU: Maki-style roll with fatty tuna, scallions, pickled daikon, and bonito flakes. Possibly our favorite item tried on our first visit. Simple but wonderful.\nUNA KYU: Maki-style roll with golden eel and cucumber. Savory and enjoyable.\nFLASH ROLL: One of the few somewhat-Americanized rolls on the menu, in five large pieces with salmon, tuna, yellowtail, avocado, and masago in soy paper. BF really enjoyed this.\n\nI can't fully express what a gem this place is. Space is small, seating a maximum of 30. Service is attentive and personable, even if seats at the bar aren't available. Fish freshness and quality was much higher than location led me to expect, with generous cuts and proper rice ratio. Dishes and quality were comparable to what we received on a recent trip to Kabuto, at half the price (though none of the grilled dishes). I live dangerously close to this spot and it will be hard to try new places with this spot right outside my backdoor.\n\nTIP: Lunch menu features a daily bento and sashimi combo, both exceptionally well-priced.", "useful": 17, "funny": 10, "cool": 14}, {"review_id": "h9Razvpl8RQZXiQRWFxNZw", "user_id": "GVVLehzorjDfrtdzpotfxg", "business_id": "ExtP8z3SVyut_RICc9i_DA", "stars": 5.0, "date": "2017-01-05", "text": "My favorite casual Mediterranean food in town.

I wanted to write a review of it after the first time we went, but never quite got around to it. Now I'm glad I didn't, because I can add more in this time after my second go-around.\n\nStout is named as a tribute to Murphy's Irish, the only Irish stout you'll find on draft here. I like that the place wants to celebrate \"the other\" Irish beer that often takes a backseat to the popular front-runner, but holds its own with a creamy, nutty flavor and full body without a bitter aftertaste. You won't want to mix Murphy's with cider unless you want something that tastes very, very sweet. Just drink it straight.\n\nThe craft beer selection here is commendable. There is always a Great Lakes beer on cask and the microbrew selections are a nice combination of American and Canadian. They turn over their kegs rather frequently too - a good thing when it comes to the quality of the taste.\n\nThe food? Very, very good. Better than you'd expect for a pub. Fries and Stout burger crisp and juicy, respectively. The bun could've used a little extra work. However, the fish and chips was OUTSTANDING. The beer batter was perfect and the fish meat itself - slimy, almost gelatinous, pretty much perfect in my eyes. Some people may be put off by just how soft and slippery the fish was (did not have a white fish meat texture), but I adored it. It was a large portion and I found myself wanting to finish all the fish because each bite had the ideal texture of crispy to mushy without being oily. \n\nStout it a winter bar. There's a fireplace in the front room, many board games for use, a dark cozy feel, and the attitude that it's best to be safe and cozy with a pint and some grub, rather than outside braving the cold.

It used to be a favorite haunt of mine eating there at least monthly, unfortunately the quality has noticeably slipped over the last year.\n\nThe FOOD: They previously had an awesome burger.  They were one of the very few establishments in Toronto that would cook a burger to order.  Unfortunately, they no longer will cook a burger to anything less than medium rare.  It also appears they've stopped grinding their meat in house.  The tasty chipotle aioli with the fries is still good (although costs extra).  \n\nThe other dishes are a bit hit and miss.  The lamb burger is quite tasty, but at $17 is way too expensive for what it is.  The shepherd's pie, which may not quite be very traditional, is still quite tasty.  On my last visit, I had the Grilled Pizza ($15) which was quite a miss.  The acidity of the tomatoes overwhelmed the spice of the merguez sausage.  Perhaps a bit more cheese might have rescued it.  My friend had the beef rouladen ($17) which was rather unremarkable and completely overwhelmed by the allspice or nutmeg seasoning.  The sp\u00e4tzle accompanying it seemed to be pan-fried, which is rather strange.  \n\nThe BEER:  They have mostly Canadian craft beer, with of course a couple Irish and more worldly options.  I would say 3 years ago, they were much more competitive with their craft beer selection.  Unfortunately, in my last couple visits, I've been hard-pressed to find much I wanted to try.  Their regular taps are filled with things like Steamwhistle, Lugtread, and Creemore which are pretty much everywhere.  Sometimes they have some interesting beers in their rotating selection, but the pickings have been slim the last few times.  Prices are a little high--consistently pushing $8 plus tax.  Good bottle list though.\n\nThe SERVICE: I have to confess it's been super awkward the last couple times.  For example, when the server noticed I'd eaten about half of my grilled pizza, she asked if I wanted it to go, and I declined.  She looked at me puzzled and asked if there was anything wrong, and I just noted that I wouldn't order it again as the flavor just wasn't quite there.  But it was all very uncomfortable and tentative.  Also, they used to always offer a small sip of a beer to help you make a decision on something you hadn't had before, but the last couple visits that practice seems to be discontinued.\n\nOVERALL, the Stout is still decent, but I've been much less satisfied with the food and beer the last few visits.  It's a good option if you live in the neighborhood, but I would no longer recommend going out of the way to eat here.", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}, {"review_id": "-b4Ql20_vnvNvuqXQZImwQ", "user_id": "YFHrehv9nlluLMmn7eUUqw", "business_id": "ExtP8z3SVyut_RICc9i_DA", "stars": 2.0, "date": "2017-02-11", "text": "Zeitouni Grill, meh- it was my second time at this restaurant.

So my friend and I decided to meet up for lunch.\n\nBeing from Henderson this drive is a little bit far. But it was well worth the drive. Nothing better than finding a hidden gem in your city that serves great food. In this case, great sushi with the freshest cuts available.\n\nWalking in to an empty restaurant is always questionable but once we started ordering, I am glad it was empty as we received our orders quickly. Everything was handmade by Chef Hiroyoshi. We were offered an omakase menu by declined it since we were pressed for time. \n\nHowever, I started the meal with a can of their Ikezo Sparkling Peach Sake. I took it without any complaints because the server suggested this drink, knowing I like my drinks sweet. She brought out the can and began shaking it. I was worried that it would explode all over us but she assured me that it would be alright as she was shaking the jelly loose from the bottom of the can. As she poured the contents from the can into the mini martini glass she brought for the drink, I was reminded of a very loose jelly shot. And that's what it practically was. A sake with jelly in it. Suffice it to say I really enjoyed it and got another can haha. 5/5\n\nWe were started off with an appetizer sent to the table by the chef. Thinly sliced yellowtail tuna with a Hamachi paste. It was the chef's own take on the typical Yellowtail and Jalape\u00f1o. If it was supposed to be spicy, I didn't get any hints of it. But that is overlooked by the freshness of the fish. Delicate. No bad aftertaste to really show you how fresh the fish is (you'll hate how many times I'll be using the word fresh). 4/5.\n\nI followed this appetizer with a tuna Toro tartar. I was slightly disappointed with it since the menu specified a quail egg, instead the server apologized and said it was topped with caviar. Couldn't go wrong with that. The saltiness and the little popping crunch of the caviar accentuated the very silky smooth of the very finely chopped tuna toro. There was enough tamari on the plate to help pull all of these flavors together without it being overpowered. 5/5\n\nNext up I ordered Hamachi Hara (Fatty Yellowtail) Nigiri and Yakima Harasu (Seared Fatty Salmon) Sashimi (yes, today was a fatty and fresh day haha). I appreciate sushi places that do not try to stuff the guest with larger portions of rice to fish ration and the chef didn't disappoint. When the Nigiri came I was delighted that the fish was the main highlight and not the rice. Very little Wasabi to detract from the dish. And the sashimi looked larger than I have ever gotten from any other sushi restaurants. All of these were  washed down a second can of sparkling jelly sake. 5/5.\n\nWith all of this talk of Hamachi, I proceeded to ask the server, if by chance, they had any kama left. She checked with the chef and came back with the news that they do have it available. So. As you all know Kama is the collar of the fish. One of the most tender meat of the fish not including the fat of the belly. This for me was the best kama I've had so far. The chef was very meticulous at removing all of the scales. In the past as I dived in to eat the skin on other Kamas, there was plenty of scales left that were overlooked by the prep cooks. Not this one.

Hiroyoshi fills a niche, offering Japanese sushi experience to those more experienced while discretely offering other, less intimidating choices to the uninitiated.\n\nTip:  Discretion requires assumptions.  If you're Japanese, you will get the full experience with no ingredients held back.  Not Japanese, rolls and less challenging ingredients (no uni, fish sperm, monk fish liver, etc) will make up your omakase.  That said, begin a dialogue with the chef if you want something in a different \"category\".\n\nNote:  This is not an Edomae experience.  Fish and seafood isn't brought to temp ahead of service rather the more common, \"everything chilled\" service.\n\nStraight to it, the rice, excellent short grained rice, gently seasoned with a pleasing salinity, very few broken grains, lightly compacted.  The seafood, uber fresh and well sourced.  As it should be, seafood is sourced from where the product is the best at the time.  Understand that highly seasonal fish will come and go.  Fish too rice ratio perfect (no need to open your throat and swallow as only half fits in your mouth).\n\nAla carte and omakase both offered.  It's fun to constantly converse with the chef, ask what's fresh, and different, and be willing to splurge and experience anything.  Omakase is however the way to go for first time visitors.  \n\nEat all sushi as served.  Each is seasoned or sauced as the chef feels best showcases the fish.  Do NOT be that guy who dunks everything in soy sauce.\n\nHighlights on a recent visit, live East Coast scallop sashimi cleaned and served in shell, candy of the sea.  A firm and gently oceanic sayori (needle fish) as sashimi and unctuous hamachi hara (yellowtail belly) as nigiri whose fat melts on the tongue and releases the best characteristics of the fish.  Live Santa Barbra abalone as nigiri has great texture and \"crush\" with a clean sweetness.  Shima aji as nigiri, huge fat content but so fresh there is no hint of fishiness, firm texture turning creamy on the palate.  Uni tempura dusted with matcha salt, very good.  As delicate crisp exterior and warm, creamy interior whose richness is tempered by the bitterness of the tea.  Needless to say, the cold water Hokkaido uni is outstanding, fresh, and creamy; the otoro properly graded and perfect with the lightly aged soy.  \n\nSushi bar typical service.  \n\nAnother welcome addition to the maturing taste of the sushi world of off the Strip Vegas.

You can also see the skewers of meat right in front of you in a visually *enticing* cooler.

They went from a very loyal customer to basically losing my business completely.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}, {"review_id": "iH0_BlCNVeE9SayKmHuh-g", "user_id": "tQb3Os_ph9glJqGIW-PdHA", "business_id": "qLUr-ZPGVJejkSXIUenw6w", "stars": 5.0, "date": "2016-04-21", "text": "Late night  gyro craving spot!  Open until 3 am on Friday and Saturday.\nWow~ I can't wait to go back to try the chicken gyro.  I had the original Greek which is pork.  Pork?  Who knew that is the authentic way to order.  Hubby had the American version of lamb/beef and brother got a feast of all 3 meats with pita and sauce.  The sauce is so yummy and the pita is fresh, soft and warm.  If you want Baklava, go early.  They were already out.  Staff was friendly and hardworking folks.", "useful": 6, "funny": 5, "cool": 8}, {"review_id": "L3y-DdOkoqaSEqIw7ILoHg", "user_id": "cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ", "business_id": "vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA", "stars": 5.0, "date": "2016-07-18", "text": "I almost didn't want to write a review for this place because....well, I'm selfish and I want to keep Sushi Hiroyoshi all to myself!! \n\nThis is truly an incredible Japanese sushi restaurant. Top quality ingredients, great service, and so much attention to detail. It's literally a little mom-and-pop type of shop, and the sushi chef, Hiro, is magnificent. I came here on a quiet Wednesday evening with a group of friends, and we had a wonderful dining experience.\n\nFirst off, THE FISH IS SO GOOD!!!!  I ordered the 3 small appetizers (1. Uni w/ steamed tofu - so creamy and not fishy at all, 2. Steamed spinach and mushrooms - a little bland but fresh, and 3. pickled jellyfish/cucumbers - fresh and light), an order of Salmon nigiri - not the best I've ever had but very good quality, an order of Chutoro nigiri - OMG, MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH GOOD, and Hiro's Tomago egg - tastes like a fresh egg cake :)  Would also highly recommend the Miso Cod which is flaky and buttery and cooked with great flavor!\n\nWhat really brings it over the top is the attention to detail. The plating is beautifully thought out, and you can tell all the dishes were made with care. Our waitress explained every dish she placed on front of us, and she was very friendly :) I ordered the miso cod and a crab roll to go, and she made sure there was ice packing for my to-go sushi order! She also easily split all our checks with no issues. A+ service!\n\nDecor is simple and clean. It's a small restaurant, and for now, it's not very busy, so it's perfect.... (I'm sure that will change soon once word gets out about how awesome this place is). \n\nWould definitely come back, and next time I'll go for the Omakase. My new fave sushi spot in town!", "useful": 7, "funny": 3, "cool": 4}, {"review_id": "ZbRsCN6zjlPv5aa6e0y7qQ", "user_id": "Rw1QE99aazERB_z3S8D8nA", "business_id": "vOMDU31gdylrzBhAKC9QbA", "stars": 2.0, "date": "2016-05-30", "text": "With the location of this restaurant being near my home and the great reviews I was anxious to try this place.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty cool and the staff was very nice.  My problem was the sushi didn't impress at all.  I hate to say it but there are just a lot better sushi places to eat at in Vegas.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}]
