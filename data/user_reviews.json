Staff at Float were super friendly and helpful, and offered me a nice peach tea while I waited for my turn to go in. It was very relaxing.\n\nI've been getting a few questions about the process so I figured it would be helpful to have some idea of what happens when you walk in.\n\nSo this is what happens when you walk in.\n\nI had already paid and made my appointment online, so I just walked in around 15 minutes before my appointment. I signed a release form, drank some tea, and waited until my turn came. A friendly member of the staff showed me to the room I would be using, explained a bit about the tank, and some advice on ear plugs, then he left me alone to do my thing. \n\nThe doors lock, so you have some privacy.\n\nI had the last float of the night, so it was 2 hours long, but standard floats during the day are around 1 hour.  They have 5 rooms, each with flotation tanks in them, and it's easy to make an appointment online, which was a major plus.\n\nEach room has a shower, a bench, and a flotation tank, and a robe. Towels & ear plugs are also provided. They have scent pre-float shampoo & body wash you can use to get ready before going into the tank, and a more scented post-float shampoo and conditioner.\n\nThe flotation tank has about 10 inches of water, and a whole bunch of dissolved salts (for max float potential), so it's easy to get into the tank, sit on the bottom, close the door, lay in the water, and then open it again, or whatever you feel comfortable with. \n\nAt first I was a little anxious about getting lost into the abyss of the tank, and it just seemed to get darker, but as I found out, it's easy to find the door handle in the dark, and easy to open it whenever you need to. So after realizing it wasn't a big deal, and that I could open the door anytime, I closed the door, and floated away 2 hours without realizing it.\n\nWhen your time is up, there is music that comes on, and gets progressively louder to gently wake you or get you out of your relaxed state.\n\nThere is no right way to do it, but I had a great time just floating around with my eyes open, enjoying the feeling of gravity mostly disappear, and also got some really good stretching in as well. Just be careful with the salt water, as you might expect, if you get it in your eyes - it stings! (but there is a towel with a water bottle near the tank door if you need to rinse)\n\nThere was only a brief moment in the beginning of my float when I heard a siren from the street, otherwise, I didn't notice any street noise at all, and considering what I saw when I left Float last night, that's really impressive (lots of police activity, another ambulance that I hadn't heard). I'm usually pretty sensitive to sound, so mostly for me it was nice to have some near-total quiet and no vibrations other than the sound of my heartbeat for a couple of hours.\n\nI think they've got a great set up, and I didn't find their prices high (especially when compared with some other float places I've seen in the past) and they've got a variety of options to choose from on their website. \n\nThe one thing that is worth mentioning, is that after floating and being relaxed and blissed out, walking out onto Queen Street at 1 am on a Friday night can be kind of shocking (not like this is a surprise of course, it's loud, and busy). I know I'd like to try and do a late night 2 hour float during the week next time.

At the moment, the vegan options are: grilled quesadillas sin queso (ask for no cheese/dairy) with either poblano peppers or mushrooms, the sopes with black beans, tlacoyos (bean filled tortillas), and opales (cactus.)

In general, I'm a big fan of the go with a few other food-loving people, order as many items as you think you can handle, and try them all. This feels like the only tactic to use at Eldorado, because it's all soooo good.\nFirst, a little booze: Eldorado has a slate of flavorful Bloody Mary-like drinks that you can order with chili infused vodka or tequila. If you want a kick in the morning, go that route. If you want something strong and sweet, I'd recommend the tequila sunrise. Yum.\n\nFor savory options: If you're looking for something classically Tex-Mex, you can't go wrong with the chilaquiles. Fried tortillas, eggs, salsa, beans, cheese, it's all there. If you want something more Tex and less Mex, the Texas Two Step is a good (and filling) choice. One huge biscuit split in half with one side covered in a sausage patty and gravy and the other paired with eggs and thick, smoky bacon. The Two Step will make you want to nap for a while, but you will enjoy every bite.\n\nAs for sweets: Let's just say this right away: Eldorado's French toast is probably the best in the city. Not overly eggy, not soggy. It's sweet and covered in cinnamon and it's CRUNCHY! They use a secret ingredient (which I won't spoil here, but ask the right waitperson and they'll clue you in) to keep the French toast interesting. It's fantastic. Aside from that, their blue corn flapjack is a star. Served with red chili butter and maple syrup, it is fluffy and flavorful.\n\nOverall, Eldorado really excels at doing brunch.

Now, it was partly my fault because I was a bit full from eating earlier that day but I also didn't really enjoy a few things about the food they served.\n\nWe were seated right away and that's always a plus in my books but it took quite a bit of time for our server to come to us. I know it's a buffet but I wanted us to get started with some drinks and look at special menu items to see whether or not we actually wanted to go for the buffet or not. The server came by soon and she was nice but not very engaging. I don't really blame her, she kinda just wanted to do her job right and get onto the next customer and she wasn't rude or anything, just bland for lack of a better word. \n\nThe decor inside is absolutely stunning. Really beautiful and quite difficult to put into words so I would really urge you to go there to check it out.\n\nIn terms of the food, it's kind of a hit or miss. All the food is fresh and hot and that's fantastic for me (I really cannot deal with lukewarm food lol) but flavours wise, some of the dishes just didn't do it for me. Indian food is all about hitting you with flavour so when some of the meat dishes (although they were nice and tender) didn't give me the flavour I was looking for, I was pretty disappointed.\n\nComing back to the problem of the server taking a while to get to us, it continued all throughout our visit. Took a while for plates to be cleared off so when I went to get dessert (and finished it), all of our main dish plates were still on the table. Dessert was also a hit or miss, but I would seriously recommend their gulab jamun.....ohhhhh my god it's good.\n\nOverall, i've definitely had better in terms of the quality of the food but I wouldn't give it a complete miss.

They're efficient and quick but show zero emotion. We were asked to wait for our table cause we wanted one by the window as it overlooked Dundas Square but we were seated maybe 2 minutes later. You get to order via an iPad and once you're done, your server comes to your table and confirms the order. \n\nOur miso soups came quite quick and everything followed suit accordingly. I'm not a fan of food invasions so I really liked that plates were brought out a few minutes apart. We only had to wait a while for some plates but definitely not the majority. \n\nSo, in terms of the quality. I thought the soups and sashimi were better than most, but their sushi was pretty mediocre, nothing special. Their teriyaki was good and deep fried items were good as well. We tried takoyaki (fried octopus balls) and beef tataki (lightly seared thinly sliced beef) and they were delicious. I ordered a seafood udon soup and it was very well done but I wasn't a fan of the calamari or crab meat. I know it's evident that these types of foods are prepared earlier but they looked almost plastic so that was unappealing. A very loud fire alarm was going off a long time and we weren't getting any straight answers from any of the servers (some said they didn't know, some said it was just a test but the announcement said the alarm had been pulled and is undergoing investigation) so that was a bit annoying.  \n\nAll U Can Eat dinner on weekends after tax is $30.

I kinda felt bad cause halfway through our visit, 3 waitresses got reduced to 1 and she ended up taking care of three big parties but she was awesome. \n\nWhen we got there we ordered an appetizer for everyone to share: the Greek Fries. Basically just fries with spices and ranch. Sounds pretty simple but it was delicious. \nThey had a good selection of food but if you're gonna be heading to All Stars, you should be going for their wings. Be ready to choose from a selection of over 130 flavors, varying in their spicyness. \n\nThe following wing flavors were ordered: This is Sparta!! (Weirdly enough, the first taste I each wing had a hint of watermelon....kinda weird but I didn't mind it; picture attached), Greek Texan (a personal favourite), Caeser Goes Texan (or something similar, this one was really good too but felt it was way too saucy and the ranch overpowered a bit), Pandora's Box (a variation of honey garlic, I didn't try this one but only heard good things), and finally, Desperado (I really liked this one and recommend it those who like it hotter than the rest!) \n\nAll Stars is always a recommend.

Usually I would be pretty upset about this but it was only one waitress responsible for our whole side; it wasn't quiet either, it was pretty crowded for how late it was. Regardless, our waitress was awesome; super friendly, cheery, and extremely efficient. She took our drink and food orders together and it arrived within 10 minutes.

Naturally, you can understand why I can't ever finish their food. One of us finished their whole two plates but the rest left a bit of each.

Yeah, that's a Denny's visit for me. \n\nThey also have free wi-fi! It was a little humid inside but it wasn't unbearable.

They had a little reptile truck, a magic show centre, a centre for kids to make art and play music etc. Tried churros for the first time (woohoo!)\n\nWe then got out of Kid's World and started hitting more of the games and rides.

I ended up getting the Thanksgiving Waffle, which was DELICIOUS despite its appearance. We also had a sample of a lemonade cocktail and couldn't resist getting our own (unfortunately I don't remember the name but they specialize mostly in fruit drinks). \n\nAfter we went to Shoppers Market and this is what killed my feet. Probably the friendliest warning of this review: please wear comfortable shoes....flats or sandals will not do it for you....trust me.

They have an international market/stage which is beautifully multicultural with vendors from almost every country and the stage features cultural performances a few times a day every day of the CNE exhibition. \n\nWe grabbed a milkshake at Baskin Robbins around 9 (we really wanted to try the Peanut Butter and Sriracha Rolls from Fran's but the line was wayyyyyy too long).

I'm hoping to re-visit this review after trying a few more plates and hopefully edit it for the better!", "useful": 2, "funny": 0, "cool": 1}, {"review_id": "wbvxem5x44TTk_7oJX-b6w", "user_id": "TYiDRwfIUBEos45ERdzeAw", "business_id": "trKyIRyjKqVSZmcU0AnICQ", "stars": 4.0, "date": "2016-01-16", "text": "Was here for a late dinner at 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and made a last minute reservation that day. Most of the tables seat groups of four and they have a larger private room in the back. After after 10 pm, they have a special - a dozen oysters for $15. \n\nFood we tried:\n- Winter Chowder ($8 - small) - tasty, comforting, not overly creamy\n- Cured Fish plate ($17) - we loved the mackerel but didn't like the pumpernickel bread it came (it was dry, dense, and sweet) and thought it could have come with more house pickled vegetables\n- Mussels and Frites ($18) - we really enjoyed this dish. The mussels were fairly large and meaty and loved the thai flavours which complemented them. The fries were crispy and delicious.\n- dozen malpeques for $15 (after 10 pm special) - oysters were delicious and well-shucked \n\nService was friendly. Ambiance was not too busy or loud and very casual.\n\nWe will definitely be back to try more dishes.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}, {"review_id": "VQI_y1nSxRcUdaly8-FJBQ", "user_id": "TYiDRwfIUBEos45ERdzeAw", "business_id": "33IS-0QBNwRC8cXnHABpbg", "stars": 4.0, "date": "2014-07-18", "text": "3.5/5\nWent here for their summerlicious menu with a group of 3. \n\nFood 3.5/5\n- started with the Cajun shrimp which was delicious and the best part of the meal\n-I also tried the watermelon gazpacho which was a nice summer starter. \n-both dishes had a bit of heat \n-I had the salmon for the main. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the wine citrus butter sauce was so delicious. However, it came with sauteed mango ginger that was mushy and did not add anything to the plate.\n-for dessert, the only choice was a trio of chocolate mousse on a cookie, mango panna cotta, and a banana spring roll with caramel sauce. I love dessert. Unfortunately, the chocolate mousse on a cookie was nothing special and the mango panna cotta tasted like fruit cocktail from the can. The best part of the trio was the banana spring roll with caramel sauce; however, that was mediocre at best.\n-we did not get a chance to try the cocktails and had a bottle of new zealand white wine\n\nService was great: 5/5.\n\nI would still come back to try the regular menu.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}, {"review_id": "PTYZpFUY53Xt8_MaPT-SHQ", "user_id": "TYiDRwfIUBEos45ERdzeAw", "business_id": "oKZPgeCOxnVSxudYcn1OtQ", "stars": 4.0, "date": "2014-05-07", "text": "I like this place - I've been there about 10 times since the summer of last year and I have always had a good time. I find that the atmosphere is best on a thursday or friday night. It's a big restaurant and I've never had to wait for a table which has become something rare in Toronto. The prices are reasonable, especially for the pasta made in house. The cocktails are also good. I've never had a problem with the service. Overall, a good place for a date, a girls night, or a group of friends.", "useful": 1, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}, {"review_id": "RSmcNwib5KqiUQknclEPHQ", "user_id": "TYiDRwfIUBEos45ERdzeAw", "business_id": "RwRNR4z3kY-4OsFqigY5sw", "stars": 3.0, "date": "2015-03-31", "text": "I love dessert and therefore had to try this cheesecake that was worth a 2 hour wait for so many people. \n\nWe had the 6 inch cheesecake and some madeleines. Everything was fresh out of the oven. The cheesecake is the fluffiest cake I've ever had - it's more like a light sponge cake with a hint of cheesecake flavour. It's fluffy when freshly baked (we tried it 25 minutes after we bought it when we got home and it was still warm). After a day in the fridge it becomes a little denser but still not as dense as a regular cheesecake.\n\nThe madeleines are the size of cupcakes and are delicious and extremely buttery. They are only good the day of.\n\nCheesecakes are $8.88 and madeleines are $2.22 each but there was a deal to buy 3 and get the 4th free. \n\nI still prefer north american cheesecake (for example, Carole's cheesecake in yorkville) but I'm glad i tried it. I felt like something was missing from the cake - like roasted almonds or another flavour but that may be because I prefer the traditional cheesecake. I would wait for the hype to die down before going back.", "useful": 0, "funny": 0, "cool": 0}]
